DNEERO END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT AND PRIVACY STATEMENT

dNeero provides online survey hosting and other survey services.

There are two primary roles within the dNeero system: 1) Blogger and 2) Researcher.  Each dNeero account can be used in either role or both roles.

BLOGGERS

Bloggers take surveys and post them to their blogs.

Bloggers must claim their blog in the account section prior to posting surveys they've taken to it.  Survey impressions will not begin to accrue until after any particular blog has been claimed.

Bloggers may only claim blogs that they have the legal right to claim.

Blogs must contain original content and can not exist for the sole purpose of taking surveys.

Blogs must in general be active.  This is defined as having at least one post per week.

Bloggers may not use software to automatically create blog posts to fulfill blog requirements.

Bloggers may not use the blogger invitation tools for outbound communications not related to surveys.

Bloggers acknowledge that from time to time dNeero must update the manner in which it embeds surveys into blogs.  At times this will involve changing the way that surveys look or act when embedded inside a blog.

Bloggers must embed a survey into their blogs using the unedited code provided by dNeero for the purpose of embedding.

Blogger agrees that all survey response data collected is owned by dNeero, who provides it to the Researcher for unlimited, non-exclusive use.  Transmission of survey response data will include information in the blogger's blogger profile (demographic information).  It will not include passwords or PayPal addresses.

In order to compensate bloggers for the amount of traffic to their blogs dNeero will collect blog traffic data.  This data is visible to the researchers of surveys that the blogger takes.

dNeero may engage in secondary sales of data collected from survey responses, blogger profiles, blog traffic data, login data and any other data collected in the due course of business.  Secondary data sales do not include the core business model of taking surveys and posting them to blogs.  Secondary sales may include aggregated depersonalized data or personally identifiable data.  dNeero commits to the following, in order to put bloggers in control of their data:

1) dNeero will give bloggers notice before including their data in any secondary data sale.  Notification may be via email and/or the blogger's private dNeero account section.  So that the blogger may make an informed decision notification must include: who is purchasing the data and how the data will be used.

2) dNeero will give bloggers an easy way to opt out of any secondary data sale during that 24 hour period.  dNeero will remove individual blogger data from the final data package sent to secondary data purchasers for any blogger who opts out.  Lack of notification will be interpreted as consent to include blogger data in the secondary data sale.

3) Any time dNeero sells data to a secondary purchaser it will share some of the money with the bloggers who created that data.  The amount may be small or large but must be disclosed in the 24 hour notification.

In addition to these commitments which ensure that the blogger has control of their data, dNeero commits to only working with companies that it deems to be of a high quality and unlikely to damage bloggers.  However, once the 24 hour notification period has passed and the data is transmitted to the secondary data purchaser dNeero assumes no liability for improper usage of the data.

As of April 20th, 2007 dNeero has no plans to sell secondary data and will focus entirely on its core business for the foreseeable future.

If such credit card charges are not accepted by the credit card processor, dNeero will place the researcher's account on hold. An ‘On-Hold’ status results in suspension of all dNeero services including survey services.
